"""
State management modelling for FLYNC.

A :class:`StateManagementGroup` is a thin coordination construct: it owns an
identity, a reference to an ordinary NM PDU (``pdu_usage:
network_management``), and a reference to a shared, bus-abstract timing
profile (:class:`GroupTiming`, reusable across groups). It owns no
communication binding and no member list - memberships are declared
entity-side (ECU / controller / bus) via :class:`StateMembershipRef` and the
effective member set per group is derived during validation.

Semantics: each participant references one or more
state bits in the group's relevance vector, each with exactly two states -
*requested* and *released*. An entity may participate in N groups; it may
enter sleep only when ALL bits and groups it registered with have released it.
A bus-level membership makes the bus ONE participant: while requested the
whole bus is kept awake, when released it may sleep as a unit; that one
participant may reference several bits when the bus is needed for several
functions. The bus cannot speak NM itself, so a proxy is derived during
validation and never modelled: for a CAN bus the proxy is the entity that
feeds the group's NM frame onto that bus; for a LIN bus - which carries no NM
message - the proxy is a LIN master that drives the LIN sleep, either as the
source of the group state (e.g. a central gateway) or after receiving it on
another bus. A CAN bus supports either variant, chosen per bus - node-level
(its ECUs / controllers, per function) or bus-level (the whole bus); a LIN bus
is bus-level only; Ethernet is node-level. A CAN bus never mixes both variants
(enforced in validation); a LIN master may additionally hold its own
membership in the same group (e.g. a central gateway that also participates
with its own functions). Richer state dimensions (e.g.
eFuse states)
are explicitly future scope. Ethernet-segment-level membership is explicitly
out of scope for now - segments have no config identity yet.

Memberships are transport-independent: NM semantics are never expressed via
socket- or frame-level config. The group's NM PDU is bound to transports
through the ordinary, untouched mechanisms (Ethernet PDU socket deployments,
CAN sender/receiver frames); validation only cross-checks that a member's
role has a matching binding (participant: TX and RX path, observer: RX
path). Until app-level membership lands with flync_4_app, controller-level
membership is the documented recommendation for multi-controller ECUs.

    Timing of a group's announcement phase.

    Whenever a bus participant changes the group's state - for instance when it
    (re)joins the network AND when it begins the go-to-sleep progression, i.e.
    on state changes generally, not only after a wake-up - it re-announces

    ----------

        already-released entity advances along the sleep progression toward the
